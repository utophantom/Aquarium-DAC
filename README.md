# Aquarium-DAS
My final highschool project: Aquarium Data Aquasistion System
Summary of the project:
•	Temperature, humidity and pH sensors are attached to the Arduino
•	The Arduino takes the analog readings and sends it periodically to the Raspberry pi
•	The Raspberry pi, as a host, will log data into an SQLite database in Python.
•	The Python program also implement tkinter to create a GUI for user interface.
•	The function of the program is: display a table and draw a chart from database, sorted with criteria, and output a .cvs file.
